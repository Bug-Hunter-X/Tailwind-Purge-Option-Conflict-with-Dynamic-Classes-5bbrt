I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  I had checked my CSS and HTML, ensuring that the classes were correctly named and included in the `tailwind.config.js` file, but the styles were not showing.  After careful review, I discovered that the problem was caused by a conflict between Tailwind's purge option and my use of dynamic class names.  Specifically, the purge configuration wasn't recognizing the dynamically generated classes, so it was removing the corresponding CSS rules.  I debugged this by inspecting the generated CSS file.
