To solve the issue, I modified the `content` array in my `tailwind.config.js` file to include the source files where dynamic classes were generated. This ensured that the purge process recognized these classes and therefore retained their associated styles in the final CSS output.  Here's how the adjusted `tailwind.config.js` looks:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [ 
    './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', // Original content
    './src/components/DynamicComponent.js' // Added to include dynamic class sources
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

The addition of `'./src/components/DynamicComponent.js'` (or the path to your relevant file) allows the purge option to accurately detect the dynamic classes. This change prevented the unnecessary removal of associated styles, resolving the issue.
